Chefsaid is a simple mobile app I made that allows the user to input any ingredients in their kitchen.
The user can also input any recipe they would like. If you have the right ingredients (and enough of them)
for a certain recipe, you can use the recipe and have your kitchen ingredients automatically reduced.

Things to be improved:
1. As of right now, when you add ingredients to your kitchen stock or to a recipe, the recipe ingredients
and the stock ingredients must be spelled the same, otherwise you won't be able to use the recipe. This
could be solved by creating a drop-down menu where the user could choose which ingredients to add. Adding
this feature would prevent the user from making typos.

2. Obviously there are many units for ingredients. There are so many that, for the sake of simplicity, I
decided not to have a feature specifying which units one must use for ingredients. I leave it up to the
user to decide which unit makes most sense for their ingredients, ie. for flower, sugar, water, milk or
for any other powder or liquid ingredient you can use a cup as the common unit. If need be you can
specify in the recipe instructions what units should be used.

3. The GUI is not the most pretty but it wasn't meant to be. I built this app for the purpose of learning
how the kivy framework works and also learn how sqlite3 works. It's my first time using both.
